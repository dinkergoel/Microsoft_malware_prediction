# Microsoft_malware_prediction
This is a part of Kaggle challenge that I have participated in. Here is the challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction

Dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data

Here are the 3 main outcomes of this project:
1) Predicted the probability of a device being infected by malware through Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. 
2) Acquired knowledge about exploratory data analysis and feature selection using Pandas and Numpy.
3) Estimated error rates and AUC scores for logistic regression, random forest models and plotted graphs for visualization.
